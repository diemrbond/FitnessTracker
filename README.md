# Fitness Tracker

## Description 
  For this project, we created a workout fitness tracker. The front end was provided, but the express server, mongoose routes and schema along with a mongo database were all required to be created. 
  
  ``As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.``
